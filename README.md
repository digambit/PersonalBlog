# PersonalBlog
This is my minimalist personal blog template, built with HTML and SASS. The project focuses on clean structure, maintainable styles, and a lightweight setup—no frameworks or CMS involved.

## ✨ Features

* SASS-powered styling: Utilizes mixins and nesting for reusable, organized CSS.
* Modular file structure: Styles are split into partials for scalability.
* Responsive layout: Designed to look good on all screen sizes.
* No build tools required: Just compile SASS to CSS and you're ready to go.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
  git clone https://github.com/digambit/PersonalBlog.git

2. Install dependencies:
  yarn install

3. Compile SASS:
  yarn dev

## 🛠️ File Structure

index.html – Main HTML file.
sass/ – SASS source files.
css/ – Compiled CSS output.
assets/ – Images and other static assets.
taskfile.yml – Task runner configuration.

## 🧠 Reflections
This was my first time using SASS in a personal project. Mixins stood out as a powerful feature for reusability, but overall, the experience felt similar to writing plain CSS—with some helpful shortcuts.
